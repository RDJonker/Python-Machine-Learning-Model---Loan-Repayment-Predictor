# Python Machine Learning Model-Loan Repayment Predictor

In this project a Machine Learning model was created to predict whether or not a client will default on their loan repayment. Various different models were created, trained and tested for accuracy and then the most accurate model was selected for the test data set. The model tested include K nearest neighbor(KNN), Logistics Regression, Decision tree classifier and Support Vector Machine(SVM). The data used in this process was collected, cleaned and normalized for the purposes of train and testing the model.
